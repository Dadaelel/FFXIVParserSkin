# Ihm's FFXIV Parser Skin

This is a skin for use with RainbowMage's ACT OverlayPlugin, for making your parses look a little more interesting.

The design for this is made to closely resemble the in-game interface.

### Important - OverlayPlugin 0.3.3.11 Required!

If you're using an older version, your settings will not be saved. To easily identify if you're on this version, just check the overlay configuration window in ACT, you should see 3 buttons labeled `Copy`, `Open DevTools` and, `Reload`, if you do then you're fine, if not then get the [latest version here](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin/releases/tag/0.3.3.11).

## How to use the skin

### The easy way

To use the skin, no download is needed. Simply use the url below as your parsers URL in the OverlayPlugin settings and you're good to go. This also means the skin will automatically be updated with any changes made!

### The hard way

If you really want to, you can download a copy of the layout completely or clone this repo and then use it locally, but you're on your own for that!
